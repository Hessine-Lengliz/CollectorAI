# Collector AI ðŸ§°ðŸ¤–ðŸ“º

**Collector AI** is an interactive and competitive AI-driven game where three distinct agents, each utilizing a unique algorithm (A*, Ad-Hoc, and Monte Carlo Tree Search), compete to collect the most trash in a complex, danger-filled environment. This game is a fusion of artificial intelligence, strategy, and dynamic challenges.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

### **Three Distinct AI Agents**
- **A*** Algorithm:
  - **Role**: Finds the shortest paths to collect trash using heuristic functions.
  - **Strengths**: Optimal for efficient navigation.
  - **Limitations**: Slower in highly complex terrains or limited memory scenarios.

- **Ad-Hoc** (Agent 1):
  - **Role**: Follows fixed rules to react swiftly, such as defending its territory.
  - **Strengths**: Fast and reactive for straightforward tasks.
  - **Limitations**: Less effective in complex tactical scenarios requiring unforeseen decisions.

- **Ad-Hoc** (Agent 2):
  - **Role**: Collects and disposes of trash.
  - **Strengths**: Flexible and adaptable to immediate changes.
  - **Limitations**: Struggles with unanticipated complex situations requiring advanced planning.

- **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)**:
  - **Role**: Simulates scenarios to maximize trash collection.
  - **Strengths**: Excels in dynamic and strategic environments.
  - **Limitations**: Requires more computation time and can be less precise with limited simulations.

### **Comparative AI Performance**
- Observe the strengths and weaknesses of different AI strategies.
- Compare efficiency, adaptability, and speed in real-time.

### **Dynamic Challenges**
- Face unpredictable obstacles that require adaptive strategies.
- Engage with a competitive AI environment.
